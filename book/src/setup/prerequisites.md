# Prerequisites

Fortunately, compared to BCML there are relatively few prerequisites for UKMM.

- A legal copy of *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, dumped to your PC
- A modern version of Windows (10 or 11) or Linux
- (Windows only) Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2019 or later ([download](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe))

That's it. (No Python, yay!)
